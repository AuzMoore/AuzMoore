## Allo'! 👋

It may look empty here for now, but I'm sure some important info will trickle in...

I am always looking for new and interesting oddities to fill my time with, though here are some of the topics of passion I always return too
- Anarchism in Academia
- Rhizomatic systems
- Perception of reality
- Social Relationships
- AI, the tools it gives us and the emergence of a new intelligence
<br>
<br>

*socials links here soon*
